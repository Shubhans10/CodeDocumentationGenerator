# Public Assets

This directory contains the static assets for the React application.

## Missing Files

The following files are referenced in the application but are not included in this repository:

- `favicon.ico` - The website icon shown in browser tabs
- `logo192.png` - A 192x192 pixel logo for PWA and app icons
- `logo512.png` - A 512x512 pixel logo for PWA and app icons

## Adding These Files

To add these files:

1. Create or obtain appropriate image files
2. Place them in this directory with the exact filenames mentioned above

If you don't add these files, the application will still work, but you may see console warnings about missing assets.
